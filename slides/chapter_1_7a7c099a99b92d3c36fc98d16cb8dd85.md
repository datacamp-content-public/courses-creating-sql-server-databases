## Organizing the design with schemas

```yaml

`@lower_third`

`@script`
Every time we've created a table in this course you might have noticed that SQL Server Management Studio placed the letters D-B-O before the name. I bet you've been wondering what that is all about.

If this little detail has been driving you nuts, then this is the movie for you.

## What Is a Schema?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: aef472ce2a
disable_transition: true
```

`@script`
SQL Server uses the concept of schemas to help organize and group database objects. This provides a number of benefits to the system. 

---

## Creating your first Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 97d892492e
```

`@part1`
```
Create Schema HumanResources
``` {{1}}

> Command(s) completed successfully {{2}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5174/datasets/990cf5278b649931461a0bb03c0793da6ca1de9a/8-Schema.png) {{2}}

`@script`
Schemas are created with a CREATE SCHEMA command and can be named however you'd like. Typically, schema names align with the departments in an organization such as warehouse, sales, or human resources. 

Or they can be named to correlate with the various clients that connect to the database such as developer or remote user.

--Ignore the below
I'll create a new schema called human resources. When I execute the statement, the new schema is created in the database.

## Move object to different schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0c87e1b60a
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5174/datasets/a4d7a679dc19dd9b74a749d6c83d4f942f1b6074/Pic7.png) {{1}}

`@script`
You can move any object from a schema to another in a very simple manner and in one simple command.
This can be done without the need to drop and re create.
Actually it is done by altering the schema destination transfer from source

---

## Move object to different schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 777877af25
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

```
Alter Schema HumanResources Transfer dbo.Employees
```

`@script`
This'll move the Employees table out of the dbo schema and bring it into HumanResources.

---

## Creating a new object within a specific Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 390350ce3a
```

`@part1`
```
CREATE TABLE [HumanResources].[Employee](
	[EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[FirstName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
	[MiddleName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
	[BirthDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[Gender] [nchar](1) NOT NULL,
	[HireDate] [date] NOT NULL)
``` {{1}}

`@script`
this script shows us how to create an object within a schema, So instead of a CREATE TABLE Employees under dbo, simply provide the schema name when naming the object

## Advantages of using Schema

```yaml

`@part1`
- Visually group objects together in Object Explorer {{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5174/datasets/9c6ba6d062b197f5933bcf7ce78145c6efae6fe5/Pic1.png) {{2}}

`@script`
So what are the benefits of using schemas?
First, schemas help to visually group related objects together. 

This is initially the most visible when looking at the Object Explorer in SQL Server Management Studio. Because it sorts objects alphabetically, all of the objects within the same schema will appear together.

## Advantages of using Schema

```yaml

`@part1`
- Create multiple systems within a single database {{1}}

`@script`
Beyond just the visual appearance though, this logical grouping of objects makes-it easier to create multiple systems within a single database.

- Managing a logical group of database objects within a database {{1}}

`@script`
As we said before Schemas allow database objects to be organized into a logical group. 

This would be advantagous when multiple teams are working on the same database application and the design team wants to maintain integrity of the database tables.

`@script`
The schema can help us in a situations where the database object name is the same but falls in a different logical group.
For instance, perhaps your sales department has a set of customers that they collect data on. And the advertising department has a separate set of their own customers. By using schemas, we can make it easy to understand which tables belong to which group.

`@part1`
- Act as object protection tool {{1}}

**Granting SELECT permission on schema Person to database user** {{2}}

```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: Sales TO WilJo 
```{{2}}

`@script`
A schema can be a very effective object projection tool combined with the appropriate level of user permissions. 

A DBA can maintain control access to an object that would be very crucial.
You can grant access to a user to the entire schema rather then granting him access to object by object 

example

## Schema Ownership

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 44c2c3aaa0
```

`@part1`
- Objects belong to a single schema {{1}}
- Schemas are owned by a user, group, or role. {{2}}
- Users can own several schemas {{3}}
- Permissions to the schema can differ between groups {{4}}

`@script`
Each object can only belong to a single schema at a time. 

Schemas can be owned by an individual user, group or roles

Each individual user of the database can own several schemas 

and have different permissions assigned to each schema which makes creating hierarchies of permissions easier to manage.

---

## Using Schemas

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: bcfa8f59bb
```

`@part1`
- Users have a default schema attached to their account {{1}}

```
CREATE USER [brian3] WITHOUT LOGIN WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA=[dbo]

``` {{2}}

`@script`
Database users can be assigned a default schema. 

Objects that they create will automatically get created within the default schema unless otherwise specified.

---

## Dropping a Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 77212be3d9
```

`@part1`
```
Drop Schema Sales
``` {{1}}
>Command(s) completed successfully {{2}} 

```
Drop Schema HumanResources
``` {{3}}
>Msg 3729, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Cannot drop schema 'HumanResources' because it is being referenced by object 'CK_Employee_BirthDate {{3}}

`@script`
Finally A schema can be simply dropped by the drop command then the schema name.

Noting that you can't drop a schema if it is being referenced by any object

## Let's practice!

In this chapter we learned what a schema is,we managed to manipulate it and explore its benefits and now it's time for you to practice
