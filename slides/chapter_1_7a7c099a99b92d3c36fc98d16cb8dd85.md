## Organizing the design with schemas

```yaml

`@script`
Every time we've created a table in this course you might have noticed that SQL Server Management Studio placed the letters D-B-O before the name. I bet you've been wondering what that's all about. 

If this little detail has been driving you nuts, then this is the movie for you.

## What Is a Schema?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: aef472ce2a
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

`@script`
SQL Server uses the concept of schemas to help organize and group database objects. This provides a number of benefits to the system. But to take full advantage, a plan must be developed that translates these object groups to the goals of the database's design.

Let's start with what a schema is. Schemas are simply containers or buckets that simplify the management of a number of objects by allowing the database administrators and SQL Server itself to apply permissions and other operations to the entire group without having to single out each and every member of the group individually.

---

## Creating your first Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 97d892492e
```

`@part1`
```
Create Schema HumanResources
``` {{1}}

> Command(s) completed successfully {{2}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5174/datasets/990cf5278b649931461a0bb03c0793da6ca1de9a/8-Schema.png) {{2}}

`@script`
Schemas are created with a CREATE SCHEMA command and can be named however you'd like. Typically, schema names align with the departments in an organization such as warehouse, sales, or human resources. Or they can be named to correlate with the various clients that connect to the database such as developer or remote user.

--Ignore the below
I'll create a new schema called human resources. When I execute the statement, the new schema is created in the database.

## Move object to different schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0c87e1b60a
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Objects in database such as tables, procedure , views and function can be grouped under schema.

You can move any object from schema to another with one simple command

---

## Move object to different schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 777877af25
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

```
Alter Schema HumanResources Transfer dbo.Employees
```

`@script`
example 
ALTER SCHEMA HumanResources TRANSFER dbo.Employees.

This'll move the Employees table out of the dbo schema and bring it into HumanResources.

---

## Creating a new object within a specific Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 390350ce3a
```

`@part1`
```
CREATE TABLE [HumanResources].[Employee](
	[EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[FirstName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
	[MiddleName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
	[BirthDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[Gender] [nchar](1) NOT NULL,
	[HireDate] [date] NOT NULL)
``` {{1}}

`@script`
To create a new object within a specific schema, simply provide the schema name when naming the object. 

This will create the Employees tables it into the HumanResources schema.




...----------------So instead of a CREATE TABLE Employees, you'd type CREATE TABLE HumanResources.Employees.

- Visually group objects together in Object Explorer {{1}}

`@script`
So what are the benefits of using schemas? First, schemas help to visually group related tables together. This is initially the most visible when looking at the Object Explorer in SQL Server Management Studio. Because it sorts objects alphabetically, all of the objects within the same schema will appear together.

- Create multiple systems within a single database {{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5174/datasets/4ba93a500668fa528618c94ca9ec242fbb710c07/Pic8.JPG) {{2}}

`@script`
Beyond just the visual appearance though, this logical grouping of objects makes it easier to create multiple systems within a single database. Where you might otherwise have separate databases for different components of a business's operations, you can use schemas to bring all of those into a single physical database.

`@script`
Schemas allow database objects to be organized into a logical group. This would be advantagous when multiple teams are working on the same database application and the design team wants to maintain integrity of the database tables.

`@script`
A schema allows a logical grouping of the database objects, so the schema can help us in situations where the database object name is the same but falls in a different logical group.
For instance, perhaps your sales department has a set of customers that they collect data on. And the advertising department has a separate set of their own customers. By using schemas, we can make it easy to understand which tables belong to which group.

`@part1`
- Act as object protection tool {{1}}

**Granting SELECT permission on schema Person to database user** {{2}}

```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: Sales TO WilJo 
```{{2}}

`@script`
A schema can be a very effective object projection tool combined with the appropriate level of user permissions. A DBA can maintain control access to an object that would be very crucial.

You can grant access to a user to the entire schema rather then granting him access to object by object 

example 

---

## Schema Ownership

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 44c2c3aaa0
```

`@part1`
- Objects belong to a single schema
- Scheams are owned by a user, group, or role.
- Users can own serveral schemas
- Permissions to the schema can differ between groups

`@script`
Each object can only belong to a single schema at a time. Schemas can be owned by an individual user

Each individual user of the database can own several schemas and have different permissions assigned to each schema which makes creating hierarchies of permissions easier to manage.

---

## Using Schemas

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: bcfa8f59bb
```

`@part1`
- Users have a default schema attached to their account {{1}}

```
CREATE USER [brian3] WITHOUT LOGIN WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA=[dbo]

``` {{2}}

`@script`
Database users can be assigned a default schema. Objects that they create will automatically get created within the default schema unless otherwise specified.

## Dropping a Schema

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 77212be3d9
```

`@part1`
```
Drop Schema Sales
``` {{1}}
>Command(s) completed successfully {{2}} 

```
Drop Schema HumanResources
``` {{3}}
>Msg 3729, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Cannot drop schema 'HumanResources' because it is being referenced by object 'CK_Employee_BirthDate {{3}}

`@script`
A schema can be simply dropped by the drop command then the schema name.

Noting that you can't drop a schema if it is being referenced by any object

## Advantages of using Schema_xxx

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 071d7c853c
```

`@part1`
- Visually group objects together in Object Explorer)xxxx
- Create multiple systems within a single database+xxxx
- Logical groups that simplify database management  {{1}}
- Greatly reduces security complexity  {{2}}

`@script`
This also makes management of the entire system more efficient since effort doesn't need to be duplicated to manage backup schedules,users in all of the other facets that maintain a working server. The other benefit of implementing a clear schema design is in the application of security. This is probably the most important benefit. Since many database objects can be assigned to a schema, granting user access permissions to the schema rather than the individual object means far fewer connections need to be made. A simple action such as granting select permissions to the sales schema to the salesperson user role covers a wide range of user object interactions.

The sales schema might encompass dozens of tables, and you might have hundreds of users within the salesperson role. With one command, you can allow all of the salespeople access to the appropriate records across the database but deny them the ability to alter the design of the tables.

---

## Using Schemas_xxxxx

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: be4aa57aae
```

`@part1`
- Users have a default schema attached to their account
- Speeds up database requests
- Use two-part Schema.OSbject names

`@script`
Database users can be assigned a default schema. Objects that they create will automatically get created within the default schema unless otherwise specified. 

Setting a default schema also has benefits with the users accessing objects within the database. When using schemas, it's considered a best practice to always use the schema name when referring to the database object. You do this by separating the schema from the object name with a period, as in Sales.Transactions which indicates the Sales schema, and within that, the table Transactions. You can also refer to objects outside of the current database by using the fully qualified name which concludes the server and the database.

## Advantages of using Schema_Junk

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5266e88075
```

`@part1`
- Object containers {{1}}
- Simplify management of groups of objects  {{2}}
- Every database begins with a .dbo schema  {{3}}
- Create schemas with T-SQL and add objects to them {{4}}

`@script`
<hr />--------------------------------
By allowing the database administrators and SQL Server itself to apply permissions and other operations to the entire group without having to single out each and every member of the group individually.

Every database begins with a single DBO, or database owner schema, and unless otherwise specified, all objects will get created in this schema.

## Creating your first Schema_Junk

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7f102b7b32
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
```
Create Schema Sales
``` {{1}}
>Command(s) completed successfully {{2}}

```
Drop Schema Sales
``` {{3}}
>Command(s) completed successfully {{4}} 

```
Drop Schema HumanResources
``` {{5}}
>Msg 3729, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Cannot drop schema 'HumanResources' because it is being referenced by object 'CK_Employee_BirthDate {{5}}

`@script`
Schemas are created with a CREATE SCHEMA command and can be named however you'd like. Typically, schema names align with the departments in an organization such as warehouse, sales, or human resources.

Droping a schema can be simply by the drop command then the schema name.

Noting that you can't drop a schema if there's belong to this schema

---

## Move object to different schema_Junk

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5c91a6deec
code_zoom: 100
```

`@part1`
```
ALTER SCHEMA HumanResources TRANSFER dbo.Employees.
```

`@script`
To move an existing object to a different schema, you'll alter the schema to include the object, as in ALTER SCHEMA HumanResources TRANSFER dbo.Employees.

This'll move the Employees table out of the dbo schema and bring it into HumanResources.
